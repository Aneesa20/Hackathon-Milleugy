# Hackathon-Milleugy
I participated in DenHague hack4good hackathon. Created an anomaly detection algorithm to be fed in a notification generation app.
## I am pleased to share that my team won the category!
We sued LSTM based anomaly detection
## Below is the idea and presentation

## Timeries modeling with LSTM autoencoder
An LSTM Autoencoder is an implementation of an autoencoder for sequence data using an Encoder-Decoder LSTM architecture.

Once fit, the encoder part of the model can be used to encode or compress sequence data that in turn may be used in data visualizations or as a feature vector input to a supervised learning model.
Autoencoders are a type of self-supervised learning model that can learn a compressed representation of input data.
LSTM Autoencoders can learn a compressed representation of sequence data and have been used on video, text, audio, and time series sequence data.
